# SmartATM-Python-based-Banking-Simulation
SmartATM is a command-line Python application that simulates real-world ATM operations. It supports secure PIN generation, balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals. Built using object-oriented programming (OOP), this project demonstrates how core banking logic can be implemented programmatically while maintaining modular and reusable code.
